Binary Calculator
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Skills tested: HTML, CSS, Javascript

Objective

In this challenge, we implement a calculator that uses binary numbers. Check out the attached tutorial for learning materials.

Task

Implement a simple calculator that performs the following operations on binary numbers: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Note that division operation must be integer division only; for example, 1001/100 = 10, 1110/101 = 10 and 101/1 = 1.

The calculator's initial state must look like this:

Element IDs. Each element in the document must have an id, specified below:

Styling. The document's elements must have the following styles:

body has a width of 33%.
res has a background-color of lightgray, a border that is solid, a height of 48px, and a font-size of 20px.
btn0 and btn1 have a background-color of lightgreen and a color of brown.
btnClr and btnEql have a background-color of darkgreen and a color of white.
btnSum, btnSub, btnMul, and btnDiv have a background-color of black, a color of red.
All the buttons in btns have a width of 25%, a height of 36px, a font-size of 18px, margin of 0px, and float value left.

The .js and .css files are in different directories, so use the link tag to provide the CSS file path and the script tag to provide the JS file path:
